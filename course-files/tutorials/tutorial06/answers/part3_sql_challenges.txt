1. Write a query that returns all of the records 
   from the tracks database where the composer 
   cell has a value (i.e., itâ€™s not null). 
   Order the query by composer name.


SELECT
 trackid,
 name,
 composer,
 unitprice
FROM
 tracks
WHERE composer is not null
 order by composer desc;



2. Write a query that calculates how many tracks each 
   composer made.  Order by the number of tracks descending.

SELECT
 composer,
 count(composer) as "Number of Tracks"
FROM
 tracks
WHERE composer is not null
GROUP BY composer
ORDER BY count(composer) desc
