# Instructions

1. Install via pip: pip install wikipedia
2. The wikipedia library directly interacts with the Wikipedia website
3. The helpers file uses Beautiful Soup to parse and read sections of a wikipedia webpage.
4. Snippets of Wikipedia can be extracted as "features" in order to do text analysis. For example, how are male and female artists represented differently on Wikipedia? Or, who is contributing to Wikipedia (which countries, gender, etc.)
