# Project 2 Instructions
Project 2 is now worth 80 points, and you have three options:
1. Complete the [Data Display](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KccLv85K3HXYB4NK2w3NEa0xpE3_xgiEvoQ6sgp_3NY/edit?usp=sharing) project<br>*my original plan*
2. Complete the [Search Engine + Enhancements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-uZyL8kPUBDn8vJTSnQfi5DTW9jT4rULZmUKl-vSMpc/edit?usp=sharing) project<br>*for folks who have already made significan progress on search engine assignment*
3. Complete at least 40 points worth of tasks from each of the projects

## Some Notes
1. You may work in pairs for this assignment (if you want).
2. This project is simply an opportunity to get a little more practice with querying and displaying data using Python. It is not the sum total of all that you know and can do in Python. No need to go overboard and do tons of optional enhancements -- fulfilling the minimum requirements is sufficient for earning full credit on this assignment.
3. When you turn in your project, please include a short write-up (doesn't even need to be complete sentences) telling the graders which option you chose to implement and which features you decided to implement. THIS IS CRITICAL for our graders.<br><br>
> **Example:** "I am doing OPTION #1, and have implemented features 1, 2, and 3 (exemplar image, summary w/search words, and stemming)." 


## Extra credit
1. If you do only one of the projects, you can earn up to 10 points extra credit (90 points total).
2. If you do both of the assignments, you can earn up to 30 points extra credit (110 points total).

## Due
**Due Tu, March 19 at 11:59PM**. Late penaly of 20% for projects that are turned in within 48 hours of the deadline. No projects will be accepted after that.
