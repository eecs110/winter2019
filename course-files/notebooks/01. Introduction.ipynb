    "> The following text and example are taken from UC Berkeley's [CS61A course textbook](http://composingprograms.com/pages/11-getting-started.html#programming-in-python), by John DeNero.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to define computational processes, we need a programming language; preferably one that many humans and a great variety of computers can all understand. In this text, we will work primarily with the Python language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a widely used programming language that has recruited enthusiasts from many professions: web programmers, game engineers, scientists, academics, and even designers of new programming languages. When you learn Python, you join a million-person-strong community of developers. Developer communities are tremendously important institutions: members help each other solve problems, share their projects and experiences, and collectively develop software and tools. Dedicated members often achieve celebrity and widespread esteem for their contributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python language itself is the product of a large volunteer community. The language was conceived and first implemented by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980's. The first chapter of his [Python 3 Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/appetite.html) explains why Python is so popular, among the many languages available today.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python excels as an instructional language because, throughout its history, Python's developers have emphasized the human interpretability of Python code, reinforced by the Zen of Python guiding principles of beauty, simplicity, and readability. To view some of Python's guiding principles, simply type `import this` at the Python command prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> import this\n",

    "    Beautiful is better than ugly.\n",
    "    Explicit is better than implicit.\n",
    "    Simple is better than complex.\n",
    "    Complex is better than complicated.\n",
    "    Flat is better than nested.\n",
    "    Sparse is better than dense.\n",
    "    Readability counts.\n",
    "    Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.\n",
    "    Although practicality beats purity.\n",
    "    Errors should never pass silently.\n",
    "    Unless explicitly silenced.\n",
    "    In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.\n",
    "    There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.\n",
    "    Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.\n",
    "    Now is better than never.\n",
    "    Although never is often better than *right* now.\n",
    "    If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.\n",
    "    If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.\n",

    "Its broad set of features support a variety of different programming styles, which we will explore. While there is no single way to program in Python, there are a set of conventions shared across the developer community that facilitate reading, understanding, and extending existing programs. Python's combination of great flexibility and accessibility allows students to explore many programming paradigms, and then apply their newly acquired knowledge to thousands of ongoing projects.\n",

Learning the rules for executing a program in appropriate order is a key learning objective in this course. Code can branch and repeat. It can be executed when particular events are called.
